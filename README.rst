``ts_logging_frontend`` is a package containing the frontend service for
displaying the different modules and logging summaries from ``ts_logging_and_reporting.``

The frontend is built using Vite and React. To run this project you need to have `node <https://github.com/nodejs/node>`_ installed.
Then you can install dependencies and run the frontend with the following commands:

::

    npm install
    npm run dev

This will start a local server on port 5173. You can access the frontend by navigating to
``http://localhost:5173`` in your web browser.

To run tests, you can use the following command:

::
    
    npm run test

This will run the tests using Vitest, a Vite-native test framework.

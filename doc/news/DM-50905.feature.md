### This PR does the following:
- Update the nightly digest frontend to fetch data using the data source adapters; Almanac, ConsDB and Narrative Log.
- Currently the following metrics cards on top of the page retrieve data from the data source adapters:
    - The exposures metrics card (expected no of exposures is still TBD)
    - Telescope Efficiency metrics card
    - Time Loss metrics card; it should show numbers other than zero if time lost data is available in the narrative log
- The no of tickets in Jira metrics card is TBD. It should be updated when the Jira adapter is created; see [DM-50983](https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-50983)

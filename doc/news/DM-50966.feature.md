### This PR changes the way dayobs range is selected. Instead of selecting start dayobs and end dayobs, user will choose a dayobs and no of nights to fetch data for, back from that dayobs. The dayobs defaults to current date, no of nights defaults to 1
- remove end dayobs date picker
- add a number input for number of nights
- add util functions to calculate start and end dayobs
